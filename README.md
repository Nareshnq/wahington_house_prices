Welcome to our presentation on Washington house prices. We have a dataset with 4,600 entries and 18 features. This rich dataset will help us understand the factors that influence house prices in Washington. First, we will explore the dataset to see patterns and trends. We will look at how prices vary in different areas and what features affect the prices the most. This will give us a clear picture of the housing market in Washington. Next, we will use machine learning to predict house prices. By building and testing different models, we can make accurate predictions about future prices. Our goal is to provide useful insights for home buyers, sellers, and policymakers to make informed decisions.
